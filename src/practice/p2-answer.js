// 2. K Largest elements
// Given a linked list of size N. The task is to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in the linked list.

// Example below:
// Input:
// LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8
// K = 4
// Output: 4 2 2 1 8 7 6 5
// Explanation:
// The first 4 elements 1, 2, 2, 4 are reversed first
// and then the next 4 elements 5, 6, 7, 8. Hence, the
// resultant linked list is 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5

// Your Task:
// You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function reverse() which should reverse the linked list in group of size k and return the head of the modified linked list.
