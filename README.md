This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# React & JavaScript Interview Preparation

### Key Areas of Focus

- **Reusable Components & State Management**: Build a UI component library (Button, Card, Modal, Navbar) with global state via Context API/Redux and navigation using React Router.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Create a responsive product grid using CSS3 Flexbox/Grid and media queries for screen size adaptability.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Practice destructuring, spread/rest operators, async/await, and higher-order functions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` to reduce re-renders in a sample shopping cart app.
- **Next.js**: Implement SSR and SSG with `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` for a blog project, with TypeScript integration.

### Quick Questions Overview

1. **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Covers hoisting, closures, promises, and event-driven models.
2. **React Concepts**: Understanding JSX, lifecycle methods, props, state, and controlled vs. uncontrolled components.
3. **Advanced Topics**: Includes Virtual DOM, RESTful services, HOCs, and performance best practices.

Each section and question has a brief answer, and assignments provide hands-on practice for mastering core skills.
